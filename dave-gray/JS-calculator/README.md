Hi this is my first README file. For this project I just followed along the instructor, its a pretty simple JS/HTML/CSS project.

## Installation

Just copy the files, or clone this repository

```bash
git clone thisRepo
```

## Usage

When you have it all installed in your computer, just open the folder with VScode and use Live Server


#Thanks for the visit ;)
