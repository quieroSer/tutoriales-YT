I just followed allong all of the long tutorial (about 6.5 hours)

I understood everything, and I learned about MongoDB and mongoose.

In the final part, chapter 14, I wasnt able to recreate everything that he did. I failed to make all of the CRUD operations under the employee route.
My understanding is that we register users, with user role as default. You can modify the users to have Editor or Admin roles dirctly over the
MongoDB web-UI. I registered a lot of users, changed the roles and everything, the Register/Auth/refresh/delete user works well, but when I tried to
get/put/post/delete employee, I wasnt able to do it.
